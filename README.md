## Who
I'm Jack Vania, game developer, programmer and artist.

## Why
This repositoryis my website. It's simple HTML because I don't care or need any CMS and HTML is generally quick when it's simple.

## Purpose
This site serves as a mini porfolio of my work.

## The Site
It's not complex nor do I want it to be. Plus I made this site fairly quickly while reading some tutorials online and just gluing some pieces together. The more I do the more I will learn and get better as I go.
